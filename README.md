# CAGED Finder

A platform that helps you find songs in order to exercise a specific scale box on the guitar fretboard.

The project goal is to parse `.gp*` files and extract information on scales and forms used inside the track.
The project uses [PyGuitarPro](https://github.com/Perlence/PyGuitarPro) (a Python port of 
[AlphaTab](https://www.alphatab.net/documentation/)) to extract information from the tabs.
